# DDEPoincareScenario.jl

DDEPoincareScenario.jl is a Julia package to compute transverse homoclinic orbits for periodic solutions of delay differential equations as described in the article [Numerical computation of transverse homoclinic orbits for periodic solutions of delay differential equations](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.00318).

## Executing the computations

[Download this repository](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/DDEPoincareScenario.jl/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and execute the files `cubic_ikeda.jl` and `mackey_glass.jl` located in the folder [examples](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/DDEPoincareScenario.jl/tree/main/examples).
